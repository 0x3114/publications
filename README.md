high-level topics that i hope to write on. essentially the idea is to build clear mental frameworks from which to dive into deeper research:
- MEV
- Blockchain-Based Virtual Machines
- Blockchain Design (A Theoretical Perspective) - Fundamental analysis distributed / decentralised systems
- Cryptography
- Open Problems in Blockchain Design (State Growth, Cost)
- Computer Science / Programming Design Considerations (i.e. Optimisations)
- Mathematics in Blockchains
- Economics, Game Theory and Other Psychology in DeFi and Blockchains

if you have any highly recommended resources (as i'm already working through a large set of low-level materials) pls feel free to send them over to me on twitter/x @0x3114!
